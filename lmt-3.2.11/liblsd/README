LSDtools is a set of reusable GPL modules that appear in various open source
projects developed at LLNL.

| liblsd error handling |
+-----------------------+

The project configure script sets the following preprocessor vars in config.h:

  WITH_LSD_FATAL_ERROR_FUNC
  WITH_LSD_NOMEM_ERROR_FUNC

causing LSD modules call the following functions upon fatal and OOM conditions:

  void lsd_fatal_error (char *file, int line, char *mesg);
  void *lsd_nomem_error (char *file, int line, char *mesg);

error.c contains the implementation of these functions, both of which print
an error message and exit.  For cerebro modules, the effect of exiting is
to terminate the cerebrod.  In general these are "should never happen"
conditions where drastic measures are justified. 

To ensure that log messages are generated when this happens, some logging
code was added to error.c as well.  In the cerebro module case, the logging
destination is set to cerebro's internal logging function, which in turn
maps to syslog (LOG_DAEMON | LOG_ERROR).  These logging functions are also
used in liblmt for fatal conditions and configurable debugging.

The project configure script also defines WITH_LSD_LIST_MYSQL_COMPAT.
This disables some code that LMT doesn't use which conflicts with MySQL
API routines.
